# Boring-Codes
Here I upload all my coding stuffs that I do during my boring time. 
Whenever I felt bored I start doing some code in Python or Java. So I thought to do it in proper way, for that I thought I can create some console applications or some big programming tasks and put in this repository. That's why putting it all here.
Basically I doing this in my 2nd year of college. I don't know, how long I continue this. 
Hope this repository brings some happy memories when I view this after a long time.
